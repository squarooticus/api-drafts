  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The Transport Services architecture <a href="#I-D.ietf-taps-arch" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-taps-arch]</a> defines a system that allows applications to use transport networking protocols flexibly. The interface such a system exposes to applications is defined as the Transport Services API <a href="#I-D.ietf-taps-interface" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-taps-interface]</a>. This API is designed to be generic across multiple transport protocols and sets of protocols features.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document serves as a guide to implementation on how to build a system that provides a Transport Services API. It is the job of an implementation of a Transport Services system to turn the requests of an application into decisions on how to establish connections, and how to transfer data over those connections once established. The terminology used in this document is based on the Architecture <a href="#I-D.ietf-taps-arch" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-taps-arch]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#implementing-basic-objects" id="implementing-basic-objects">Implementing Basic Objects</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The basic objects that are exposed to applications for Transport Services are the Preconnection, the bundle of properties that describes the application constraints on the transport; the Connection, the basic object that represents a flow of data in either direction between the Local and Remote Endpoints; and the Listener, a passive waiting object that delivers new Connections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Preconnection objects should be implemented as bundles of properties that an application can both read and write. Once a Preconnection has been used to create an outbound Connection or a Listener, the implementation should ensure that the copy of the properties held by the Connection or Listener is immutable. This may involve performing a deep-copy if the application is still able to modify properties on the original Preconnection object.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Connection objects represent the interface between the application and the implementation to manage transport state, and conduct data transfer. During the process of establishment (<a href="#conn-establish" class="xref">Section 4</a>), the Connection will be unbound to a specific transport flow, since there may be multiple candidate Protocol Stacks being raced. Once the Connection is established, the object should be considered mapped to a specific Protocol Stack. The notion of a Connection maps to many different protocols, depending on the Protocol Stack. For example, the Connection may ultimately represent the interface into a TCP connection, a TLS session over TCP, a UDP flow with fully-specified local and remote endpoints, a DTLS session, a SCTP stream, a QUIC stream, or an HTTP/2 stream.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">The properties specified during pre-establishment have a close connection to system policy. The implementation is responsible for combining and reconciling several different sources of preferences when establishing Connections. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Application preferences, i.e., preferences specified during the pre-establishment via Selection Properties.</li>
<li>Dynamic system policy, i.e., policy compiled from internally and externally acquired information about available network interfaces, supported transport protocols, and current/previous Connections.

Similarly, the system policy at a given time may prohibit the use of such a metered network interface from the application&#8217;s process.

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The process of establishing a network connection begins when an application expresses intent to communicate with a remote endpoint by calling Initiate. (At this point, any constraints or requirements the application may have on the connection are available from pre-establishment.) The process can be considered complete once there is at least one Protocol Stack that has completed any required setup to the point that it can transmit and receive the application&#8217;s data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">Connection establishment is divided into two top-level steps: Candidate Gathering, to identify the paths, protocols, and endpoints to use, and Candidate Racing, in which the necessary protocol handshakes are conducted so that the transport system can select which set to use. This document structures candidates for racing as a tree.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The most simple example of this process might involve identifying the single IP address to which the implementation wishes to connect, using the system&#8217;s current default interface or path, and starting a TCP handshake to establish a stream to the specified IP address. However, each step may also vary depending on the requirements of the connection: if the endpoint is defined as a hostname and port, then there may be multiple resolved addresses that are available; there may also be multiple interfaces or paths available, other than the default system interface; and some protocols may not need any transport handshake to be considered &#8220;established&#8221; (such as UDP), while other connections may utilize layered protocol handshakes, such as TLS over TCP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">Whenever an implementation has multiple options for connection establishment, it can view the set of all individual connection establishment options as a single, aggregate connection establishment. The aggregate set conceptually includes every valid combination of endpoints, paths, and protocols. As an example, consider an implementation that initiates a TCP connection to a hostname + port endpoint, and has two valid interfaces available (Wi-Fi and LTE). The hostname resolves to a single IPv4 address on the Wi-Fi network, and resolves to the same IPv4 address on the LTE network, as well as a single IPv6 address. The aggregate set of connection establishment options can be viewed as follows:</p>
<pre>
Aggregate [Endpoint: www.example.com:80] [Interface: Any]   [Protocol: TCP]
|-&gt; [Endpoint: 192.0.2.1:80]       [Interface: Wi-Fi] [Protocol: TCP]

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.1.p.1">The set of possible Local Endpoints is gathered.  In the simple case, this merely enumerates the local interfaces and protocols, allocates ephemeral source ports.  For example, a system that has WiFi and Ethernet and supports IPv4 and IPv6 might gather four candidate locals (IPv4 on Ethernet, IPv6 on Ethernet, IPv4 on WiFi, and IPv6 on WiFi) that can form the source for a transient.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.1.p.2">If NAT traversal is required, the process of gathering Local Endpoints becomes broadly equivalent to the ICE candidate gathering phase <a href="#RFC5245" class="xref">[RFC5245]</a>.  The endpoint determines its server reflexive Local Endpoints (i.e., the translated address of a local, on the other side of a NAT) and relayed locals (e.g., via a TURN server or other relay), for each interface and network protocol.  These are added to the set of candidate Local Endpoints for this connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.1.p.3">Gathering Local Endpoints is primarily a local operation, although it might involve exchanges with a STUN server to derive server reflexive locals, or with a TURN server or other relay to derive relayed locals.

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.2.p.2">How this is done will depend on the type of the Remote Endpoint, and can also be specific to each Local Endpoint.  A common case is when the Remote Endpoint is a DNS name, in which case it is resolved to give a set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses representing that name.  Some types of remote might require more complex resolution.  Resolving the Remote Endpoint for a peer-to-peer connection might involve communication with a rendezvous server, which in turn contacts the peer to gain consent to communicate and retrieve its set of candidate locals, which are returned and form the candidate remote addresses for contacting that peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.2.p.3">Resolving the remote is not a local operation.  It will involve a directory service, and can require communication with the remote to rendezvous and exchange peer addresses.  This can expose some or all of the candidate locals to the remote.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.1">When an implementation responsible for connection establishment needs to consider multiple options, it should logically structure these options as a hierarchical tree. Each leaf node of the tree represents a single, coherent connection attempt, with an Endpoint, a Path, and a set of protocols that can directly negotiate and send data on the network. Each node in the tree that is not a leaf represents a connection attempt that is either underspecified, or else includes multiple distinct options. For example. when connecting on an IP network, a connection attempt to a hostname and port is underspecified, because the connection attempt requires a resolved IP address as its remote endpoint. In this case, the node represented by the connection attempt to the hostname is a parent node, with child nodes for each IP address. Similarly, an implementation that is allowed to connect using multiple interfaces will have a parent node of the tree for the decision between the paths, with a branch for each interface.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">Branching between paths is the first in the list because results across multiple interfaces are likely not related to one another: endpoint resolution may return different results, especially when using locally resolved host and service names, and which protocols are supported and preferred may differ across interfaces. Thus, if multiple paths are attempted, the overall connection can be seen as a race between the available paths or interfaces.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.5">Protocol options are checked next in order. Whether or not a set of protocol, or protocol-specific options, can successfully connect is generally not dependent on which specific IP address is used. Furthermore, the protocol stacks being attempted may influence or altogether change the endpoints being used. Adding a proxy to a connection&#8217;s branch will change the endpoint to the proxy&#8217;s IP address or hostname. Choosing an alternate protocol may also modify the ports that should be selected.</p>

However, if the implementation has cached the information that SCTP is not available on the path over WiFi, there is no SCTP node in the WiFi subtree. Here, the path over WiFi will be tried first, and, if connection establishment succeeds, TCP will be used. So the Selection Property of preferring WiFi takes precedence over the Property that led to a preference for SCTP.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">The primary goal of the Candidate Racing process is to successfully negotiate a protocol stack to an endpoint over an interface&#8212;to connect a single leaf node of the tree&#8212;with as little delay and as few unnecessary connections attempts as possible. Optimizing these two factors improves the user experience, while minimizing network load.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.2">This section covers the dynamic aspect of connection establishment. While the tree described above is a useful conceptual and architectural model, an implementation does not know what the full tree may become up front, nor will many of the possible branches be used in the common case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.3">There are three different approaches to racing the attempts for different nodes of the connection establishment tree:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Immediate</li>
<li>Delayed</li>
<li>Failover</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.5">Each approach is appropriate in different use-cases and branch types. However, to avoid consuming unnecessary network resources, implementations should not use immediate racing as a default approach.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.6">The timing algorithms for racing should remain independent across branches of the tree. Any timers or racing logic is isolated to a given parent node, and is not ordered precisely with regards to other children of other nodes.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.4.4.1">4.4.1.</a> <a href="#delayed" id="delayed">Delayed</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.1">Delayed racing can be used whenever a single node of the tree has multiple child nodes. Based on the order determined when building the tree, the first child node will be initiated immediately, followed by the next child node after some delay. Once that second child node is initiated, the third child node (if present) will begin after another delay, and so on until all child nodes have been initiated, or one of the child nodes successfully completes its negotiation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.2">Delayed racing attempts occur in parallel. Implementations should not terminate an earlier child connection attempt upon starting a secondary child.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.3">The delay between starting child nodes should be based on the properties of the previously started child node. For example, if the first child represents an IP address with a known route, and the second child represents another IP address, the delay between starting the first and second IP addresses can be based on the expected retransmission cadence for the first child&#8217;s connection (derived from historical round-trip-time). Alternatively, if the first child represents a branch on a Wi-Fi interface, and the second child represents a branch on an LTE interface, the delay should be based on the expected time in which the branch for the first interface would be able to establish a connection, based on link quality and historical round-trip-time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.4">Any delay should have a defined minimum and maximum value based on the branch type. Generally, branches between paths and protocols should have longer delays than branches between derived endpoints. The maximum delay should be considered with regards to how long a user is expected to wait for the connection to complete.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.5">If a child node fails to connect before the delay timer has fired for the next child, the next child should be started immediately.</p>

Failure of a leaf node is determined by its protocol negotiation failing or timing out; failure of a parent branching node is determined by all of its children failing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.2.p.2">An example in which failover is recommended is a race between a protocol stack that uses a proxy and a protocol stack that bypasses the proxy. Failover is useful in case the proxy is down or misconfigured, but any more aggressive type of racing may end up unnecessarily avoiding a proxy that was preferred by policy.</p>

The first leaf node to complete its connection is then used by the application to send and receive data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.2">It is useful to process success and failure throughout the tree by child nodes reporting to their parent nodes (towards the trunk of the tree). For example, in the following case, if 1.1.1 fails to connect, it reports the failure to 1.1. Since 1.1 has no other child nodes, it also has failed and reports that failure to 1. Because 1.2 has not yet failed, 1 is not considered to have failed. Since 1.2 has not yet started, it is started and the process continues. Similarly, if 1.1.1 successfully connects, then it marks 1.1 as connected, which propagates to the trunk node 1. At this point, the connection as a whole is considered to be successfully connected and ready to process application data</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.3">If a leaf node has successfully completed its connection, all other attempts should be made ineligible for use by the application for the original request. New connection attempts that involve transmitting data on the network should not be started after another leaf node has completed successfully, as the connection as a whole has been established. An implementation may choose to let certain handshakes and negotiations complete in order to gather metrics to influence future connections. Similarly, an implementation may choose to hold onto fully established leaf nodes that were not the first to establish for use in future connections, but this approach is not recommended since those attempts were slower to connect and may exhibit less desirable properties.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.5.1.p.1">Implementations may select the criteria by which a leaf node is considered to be successfully connected differently on a per-protocol basis. If the only protocol being used is a transport protocol with a clear handshake, like TCP, then the obvious choice is to declare that node &#8220;connected&#8221; when the last packet of the three-way handshake has been received. If the only protocol being used is an &#8220;unconnected&#8221; protocol, like UDP, the implementation may consider the node fully &#8220;connected&#8221; the moment it determines a route is present, before sending any packets on the network, see further <a href="#unconnected-racing" class="xref">Section 4.7</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.1.p.2">For protocol stacks with multiple handshakes, the decision becomes more nuanced. If the protocol stack involves both TLS and TCP, an implementation could determine that a leaf node is connected after the TCP handshake is complete, or it can wait for the TLS handshake to complete as well. The benefit of declaring completion when the TCP handshake finishes, and thus stopping the race for other branches of the tree, is that there will be less burden on the network from other connection attempts. On the other hand, by waiting until the TLS handshake is complete, an implementation avoids the scenario in which a TCP handshake completes quickly, but TLS negotiation is either very slow or fails altogether in particular network conditions or to a particular endpoint. To avoid the issue of TLS possibly failing, the implementation should not generate a Ready event for the Connection until TLS is established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.1.p.3">If all of the leaf nodes fail to connect during racing, i.e. none of the configurations that satisfy all requirements given in the Transport Parameters actually work over the available paths, then the transport system should notify the application with an InitiateError event. An InitiateError event should also be generated in case the transport system finds no usable candidates to race.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.1">Multiplexing several Connections over a single underlying transport connection requires that the Connections to be multiplexed belong to the same Connection Group (as is indicated by the application using the Clone call). When the underlying transport connection supports multi-streaming, the Transport System can map each Connection in the Connection Group to a different stream.  Thus, when the Connections that are offered to an application by the Transport System are multiplexed, the Transport System may implement the establishment of a new Connection by simply beginning to use a new stream of an already established transport connection and there is no need for a connection establishment procedure. This, then, also means that there may not be any &#8220;establishment&#8221; message (like a TCP SYN), but the application can simply start sending or receiving. Therefore, when the Initiate action of a Transport System is called without Messages being handed over, it cannot be guaranteed that the other endpoint will have any way to know about this, and hence a passive endpoint&#8217;s ConnectionReceived event may not be called upon an active endpoint&#8217;s Inititate.  Instead, calling the ConnectionReceived event may be delayed until the first Message arrives.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.1">While protocols that use an explicit handshake to validate a Connection to a peer can be used for racing multiple establishment attempts in parallel, &#8220;unconnected&#8221; protocols such as raw UDP do not offer a way to validate the presence of a peer or the usability of a Connection without application feedback. An implementation should consider such a protocol stack to be established as soon as a local route to the peer endpoint is confirmed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.2">However, if a peer is not reachable over the network using the unconnected protocol, or data cannot be exchanged for any other reason, the application may want to attempt using another candidate Protocol Stack. The implementation should maintain the list of other candidate Protocol Stacks that were eligible to use. In the case that the application signals that the initial Protocol Stack is failing for some reason and that another option should be attempted, the Connection can be updated to point to the next candidate Protocol Stack.

<ul>
<li>Lifetime: this should be implemented by removing the Message from its queue of pending Messages after the Lifetime has expired. A queue of pending Messages within the transport system implementation that have yet to be handed to the Protocol Stack can always support this property, but once a Message has been sent into the send buffer of a protocol, only certain protocols may support de-queueing a message. For example, TCP cannot remove bytes from its send buffer, while in case of SCTP, such control over the SCTP send buffer can be exercised using the partial reliability extension <a href="#RFC8303" class="xref">[RFC8303]</a>. When there is no standing queue of Messages within the system, and the Protocol Stack does not support removing a Message from its buffer, this property may be ignored.</li>
<li>Priority: this represents the ability to prioritize a Message over other Messages. This can be implemented by the system re-ordering Messages that have yet to be handed to the Protocol Stack, or by giving relative priority hints to protocols that support priorities per Message. For example, an implementation of HTTP/2 could choose to send Messages of different Priority on streams of different priority.</li>
<li>Ordered: when this is false, it disables the requirement of in-order-delivery for protocols that support configurable ordering.</li>
<li>Idempotent: when this is true, it means that the Message can be used by mechanisms that might transfer it multiple times &#8211; e.g., as a result of racing multiple transports or as part of TCP Fast Open.</li>
<li>Final: when this is true, it means that a transport connection can be closed immediately after its transmission.</li>
<li>Corruption Protection Length: when this is set to any value other than -1, it limits the required checksum in protocols that allow limiting the checksum length (e.g. UDP-Lite).</li>
<li>Transmission Profile: TBD &#8211; because it&#8217;s not final in the API yet.  Old text follows: when this is&#160;set to &#8220;Interactive/Low Latency&#8221;, the Message should be sent immediately, even when this comes at the cost of using the network capacity less efficiently. For example, small messages can sometimes be bundled to fit into a single data packet for the sake of reducing header overhead; such bundling should not be used. For example, in case of TCP, the Nagle algorithm should be disabled when Interactive/Low Latency is selected as the capacity profile. Scavenger/Bulk can translate into usage of a congestion control mechanism such as LEDBAT, and/or the capacity profile can lead to a choice of a DSCP value as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-taps-minset" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-taps-minset]</a>).</li>
<li>Singular Transmission: when this is true, the application requests to avoid transport-layer segmentation or network-layer fragmentation. Some transports implement network-layer fragmentation avoidance (Path MTU Discovery) without exposing this functionality to the application; in this case, only transport-layer segmentation should be avoided, by fitting the message into a single transport-layer segment or otherwise failing. Otherwise, network-layer fragmentation should be avoided&#8212;e.g. by requesting the IP Don&#8217;t Fragment bit to be set in case of UDP(-Lite) and IPv4 (SET_DF in <a href="#RFC8304" class="xref">[RFC8304]</a>).</li>

The main difference with Receiving is that the size and boundaries of the Message are not known beforehand. The application can communicate in its Receive action the parameters for the Message, which can help the implementation know how much data to deliver and when. For example, if the application only wants to receive a complete Message, the implementation should wait until an entire Message (datagram, stream, or frame) is read before delivering any Message content to the application. This requires the implementation to understand where messages end, either via a supplied deframer or because the top-level protocol in the established Protocol Stack preserves message boundaries; if, on the other hand, the top-level protocol only supports a byte-stream and no deframers were supported, the application must specify the minimum number of bytes of Message content it wants to receive (which may be just a single byte) to control the flow of received data.</p>

This approach is referred to as sending Zero-RTT (0-RTT) data. This is a desirable property, but poses challenges to an implementation that uses racing during connection establishment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">If the application has 0-RTT data to send in any protocol handshakes, it needs to provide this data before the handshakes have begun. When racing, this means that the data should be provided before the process of connection establishment has begun. If the application wants to send 0-RTT data, it must indicate this to the implementation by setting the Idempotent send parameter to true when sending the data. In general, 0-RTT data may be replayed (for example, if a TCP SYN contains data, and the SYN is retransmitted, the data will be retransmitted as well), but racing means that different leaf nodes have the opportunity to send the same data independently. If data is truly idempotent, this should be permissible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">Once the application has provided its 0-RTT data, an implementation should keep a copy of this data and provide it to each new leaf node that is started and for which a 0-RTT protocol is being used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">It is also possible that protocol stacks within a particular leaf node use 0-RTT handshakes without any idempotent application data. For example, TCP Fast Open could use a Client Hello from TLS as its 0-RTT data, shortening the cumulative handshake time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.5">0-RTT handshakes often rely on previous state, such as TCP Fast Open cookies, previously established TLS tickets, or out-of-band distributed pre-shared keys (PSKs). Implementations should be aware of security concerns around using these tokens across multiple addresses or paths when racing. In the case of TLS, any given ticket or PSK should only be used on one leaf node. If implementations have multiple tickets available from a previous connection, each leaf node attempt must use a different ticket. In effect, each leaf node will send the same early application data, yet encoded (encrypted) differently on the wire.</p>

However, with TCP only, &#8220;close&#8221; does not mean that the application will stop receiving data. This is related to TCP&#8217;s ability to support half-closed connections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">SCTP is an example of a protocol that does not support such half-closed connections.  Hence, with SCTP, the meaning of &#8220;close&#8221; is stricter: an application has no more data to send (but expects all data that has been handed over to be reliably delivered), and will also not receive any more data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">Implementing a protocol independent transport system means that the exposed semantics must be the strictest subset of the semantics of all supported protocols.  Hence, as is common with all reliable transport protocols, after a Close action, the application can expect to have its reliability requirements honored regarding the data it has given to the Transport System, but it cannot expect to be able to read any more data after calling Close.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">Abort differs from Close only in that no guarantees are given regarding data that the application has handed over to the Transport System before calling Abort.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">As explained in <a href="#establish-mux" class="xref">Section 4.6</a>, when a new stream is multiplexed on an already existing connection of a Transport Protocol Instance, there is no need for a connection establishment procedure. Because the Connections that are offered by the Transport System can be implemented as streams that are multiplexed on a transport protocol&#8217;s connection, it can therefore not be guaranteed that one Endpoint&#8217;s Initiate action provokes a ConnectionReceived event at its peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.6">For Close (provoking a Finished event) and Abort (provoking a ConnectionError event), the same logic applies: while it is desirable to be informed when a peer closes or aborts a Connection, whether this is possible depends on the underlying protocol, and no guarantees can be given. With SCTP, the transport system can use the stream reset procedure to cause a Finish event upon a Close action from the peer <a href="#NEAT-flow-mapping" class="xref">[NEAT-flow-mapping]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#cached-state" id="cached-state">Cached State</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">Beyond a single Connection&#8217;s lifetime, it is useful for an implementation to keep state and history. This cached state can help improve future Connection establishment due to re-using results and credentials, and favoring paths and protocols that performed well in the past.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">Cached state may be associated with different Endpoints for the same Connection, depending on the protocol generating the cached content.  For example, session tickets for TLS are associated with specific endpoints, and thus should be cached based on a Connection&#8217;s hostname Endpoint (if applicable). On the other hand, performance characteristics of a path are more likely tied to the IP address and subnet being used.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.1">8.1.</a> <a href="#protocol-state-caches" id="protocol-state-caches">Protocol state caches</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">Some protocols will have long-term state to be cached in association with Endpoints. This state often has some time after which it is expired, so the implementation should allow each protocol to specify an expiration for cached content.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">Examples of cached protocol state include:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The DNS protocol can cache resolution answers (A and AAAA queries, for example), associated with a Time To Live (TTL) to be used for future hostname resolutions without requiring asking the DNS resolver again.</li>
<li>TLS caches session state and tickets based on a hostname, which can be used for resuming sessions with a server.</li>
<li>TCP can cache cookies for use in TCP Fast Open.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.4">Cached protocol state is primarily used during Connection establishment for a single Protocol Stack, but may be used to influence an implementation&#8217;s preference between several candidate Protocol Stacks. For example, if two IP address Endpoints are otherwise equally preferred, an implementation may choose to attempt a connection to an address for which it has a TCP Fast Open cookie.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.5">Applications must have a way to flush protocol cache state if desired. This may be necessary, for example, if application-layer identifiers rotate and clients wish to avoid linkability via trackable TLS tickets or TFO cookies.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.2">8.2.</a> <a href="#performance-caches" id="performance-caches">Performance caches</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.1">In addition to protocol state, Protocol Instances should provide data into a performance-oriented cache to help guide future protocol and path selection. Some performance information can be gathered generically across several protocols to allow predictive comparisons between protocols on given paths:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Observed Round Trip Time</li>
<li>Connection Establishment latency</li>
<li>Connection Establishment success rate</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.3">These items can be cached on a per-address and per-subnet granularity, and averaged between different values. The information should be cached on a per-network basis, since it is expected that different network attachments will have different performance characteristics. Besides Protocol Instances, other system entities may also provide data into performance-oriented caches. This could for instance be signal strength information reported by radio modems like Wi-Fi and mobile broadband or information about the battery-level of the device. Furthermore, the system may cache the observed maximum throughput on a path as an estimate of the available bandwidth.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.4">An implementation should use this information, when possible, to determine preference between candidate paths, endpoints, and protocol options. Eligible options that historically had significantly better performance than others should be selected first when gathering candidates (see <a href="#gathering" class="xref">Section 4.1</a>) to ensure better performance for the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.5">The reasonable lifetime for cached performance values will vary depending on the nature of the value. Certain information, like the connection establishment success rate to a Remote Endpoint using a given protocol stack, can be stored for a long period of time (hours or longer), since it is expected that the capabilities of the Remote Endpoint are not changing very quickly. On the other hand, Round Trip Time observed by TCP over a particular network path may vary over a relatively short time interval. For such values, the implementation should remove them from the cache more quickly, or treat older values with less confidence/weight.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.9.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.1">9.1.</a> <a href="#tcp" id="tcp">TCP</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">Connection lifetime for TCP translates fairly simply into the the abstraction presented to an application. When the TCP three-way handshake is complete, its layer of the Protocol Stack can be considered Ready (established). This event will cause racing of Protocol Stack options to complete if TCP is the top-level protocol, at which point the application can be notified that the Connection is Ready to send and receive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.2">If the application sends a Close, that can translate to a graceful termination of the TCP connection, which is performed by sending a FIN to the remote endpoint. If the application sends an Abort, then the TCP state can be closed abruptly, leading to a RST being sent to the peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.3">Without a layer of framing (a top-level protocol in the established Protocol Stack that preserves message boundaries, or an application-supplied deframer) on top of TCP, the receiver side of the transport system implementation can only treat the incoming stream of bytes as a single Message, terminated by a FIN when the Remote Endpoint closes the Connection.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.2">9.2.</a> <a href="#udp" id="udp">UDP</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.1">UDP as a direct transport does not provide any handshake or connectivity state, so the notion of the transport protocol becoming Ready or established is degenerate. Once the system has validated that there is a route on which to send and receive UDP datagrams, the protocol is considered Ready. Similarly, a Close or Abort has no meaning to the on-the-wire protocol, but simply leads to the local state being torn down.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.2">When sending and receiving messages over UDP, each Message should correspond to a single UDP datagram. The Message can contain metadata about the packet, such as the ECN bits applied to the packet.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.3">9.3.</a> <a href="#sctp" id="sctp">SCTP</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">To support sender-side stream schedulers (which are implemented on the sender side), a receiver-side Transport System should always support message interleaving <a href="#RFC8260" class="xref">[RFC8260]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">SCTP messages can be very large. To allow the reception of large messages in pieces, a &#8220;partial flag&#8221; can be used to inform a (native SCTP) receiving application that a message is incomplete. After receiving the &#8220;partial flag&#8221;, this application would know that the next receive calls will only deliver remaining parts of the same message (i.e., no messages or partial messages will arrive on other streams until the message is complete) (see Section 8.1.20 in <a href="#RFC6458" class="xref">[RFC6458]</a>). The &#8220;partial flag&#8221; can therefore facilitate the implementation of the receiver buffer in the receiving application, at the cost of limiting multiplexing and temporarily creating head-of-line blocking delay at the receiver.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">When a Transport System transfers a Message, it seems natural to map the Message object to SCTP messages in order to support properties such as &#8220;Ordered&#8221; or &#8220;Lifetime&#8221; (which maps onto partially reliable delivery with a SCTP_PR_SCTP_TTL policy <a href="#RFC6458" class="xref">[RFC6458]</a>). However, since multiplexing of Connections onto SCTP streams may happen, and would be hidden from the application, the Transport System requires a per-stream receiver buffer anyway, so this potential benefit is lost and the &#8220;partial flag&#8221; becomes unnecessary for the system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.4">The problem of long messages either requiring large receiver-side buffers or getting in the way of multiplexing is addressed by message interleaving <a href="#RFC8260" class="xref">[RFC8260]</a>, which is yet another reason why a receivers-side transport system supporting SCTP should implement this mechanism.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.4">9.4.</a> <a href="#tls" id="tls">TLS</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">The mapping of a TLS stream abstraction into the application is equivalent to the contract provided by TCP (see <a href="#tcp" class="xref">Section 9.1</a>). The Ready state should be determined by the completion of the TLS handshake, which involves potentially several more round trips beyond the TCP handshake. The application should not be notified that the Connection is Ready until TLS is established.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.5">9.5.</a> <a href="#http" id="http">HTTP</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">HTTP requests and responses map naturally into Messages, since they are delineated chunks of data with metadata that can be sent over a transport. To that end, HTTP can be seen as the most prevalent framing protocol that runs on top of streams like TCP, TLS, etc.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.2">In order to use a transport Connection that provides HTTP Message support, the establishment and closing of the connection can be treated as it would without the framing protocol. Sending and receiving of Messages, however, changes to treat each Message as a well-delineated HTTP request or response, with the content of the Message representing the body, and the Headers being provided in Message metadata.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.6">9.6.</a> <a href="#quic" id="quic">QUIC</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.1">QUIC provides a multi-streaming interface to an encrypted transport. Each stream can be viewed as equivalent to a TLS stream over TCP, so a natural mapping is to present each QUIC stream as an individual Connection. The protocol for the stream will be considered Ready whenever the underlying QUIC connection is established to the point that this stream&#8217;s data can be sent. For streams after the first stream, this will likely be an immediate operation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.2">Closing a single QUIC stream, presented to the application as a Connection, does not imply closing the underlying QUIC connection itself. Rather, the implementation may choose to close the QUIC connection once all streams have been closed (possibly after some timeout), or after an individual stream Connection sends an Abort.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.3">Messages over a direct QUIC stream should be represented similarly to the TCP stream (one Message per direction, see <a href="#tcp" class="xref">Section 9.1</a>), unless a framing mapping is used on top of QUIC.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.7">9.7.</a> <a href="#http2-transport" id="http2-transport">HTTP/2 transport</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.1">Similar to QUIC (<a href="#quic" class="xref">Section 9.6</a>), HTTP/2 provides a multi-streaming interface. This will generally use HTTP as the unit of Messages over the streams, in which each stream can be represented as a transport Connection. The lifetime of streams and the HTTP/2 connection should be managed as described for QUIC.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.2">It is possible to treat each HTTP/2 stream as a raw byte-stream instead of a carrier for HTTP messages, in which case the Messages over the streams can be represented similarly to the TCP stream (one Message per direction, see <a href="#tcp" class="xref">Section 9.1</a>).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.2">An attacker that knows a particular device is racing several options during connection establishment may be able to block packets for the first connection attempt, thus inducing the device to fall back to a secondary attempt. This is a problem if the secondary attempts have worse security properties that enable further attacks. Implementations should ensure that all options have equivalent security properties to avoid incentivizing attacks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.3">Since results from the network can determine how a connection attempt tree is built, such as when DNS returns a list of resolved endpoints, it is possible for the network to cause an implementation to consume significant on-device resources.
